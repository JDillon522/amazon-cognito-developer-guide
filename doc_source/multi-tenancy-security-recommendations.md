# Multi\-tenancy security recommendations<a name="multi-tenancy-security-recommendations"></a>

 The following recommendations can help make your application more secure\. 
+ Avoid using an unverified email address to authorize user access to a tenant based on domain match\. Email addresses and phone numbers shouldnâ€™t be trusted unless they are verified by your application or a proof of verification is given by the external IdP\. For more details on setting these permissions, see [Attribute Permissions and Scopes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-attributes.html#user-pool-settings-attribute-                     permissions-and-scopes.html)\.
+ Make sure that user profile attributes used to identify tenants are immutable or mutable attributes that can be changed by administrators\. Application clients should have read\-only access to these attributes\.
+ Ensure you have 1:1 mapping between external IdP and application client to prevent unauthorized cross\-tenant access\. A user that has been authenticated by an external IdP, and that has a valid Amazon Cognito session cookie, can access other tenant apps that trust the same IdP\. 
+ When implementing tenant\-matching and authorization logic in your application, ensure that the criteria used to authorize user access to the tenants can't be modified by users themselves\. You should also ensure that user access can't be modified by the tenant identity provider administrators \(if an external IdP is being used for federation\)\.
