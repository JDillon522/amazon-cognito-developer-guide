 Amazon Cognito provides CloudWatch usage metrics that correspond to the AWS service quotas for `CallCount` and `ThrottleCount` APIs\. For more information about tracking usage in CloudWatch, see [Track quota usage](limits.md#track-quota-usage)\.

In the Service Quotas console, you can create alarms that alert you when your usage approaches a service quota\. To learn how to set up a CloudWatch alarm using the Service Quotas console, see [Service Quotas and CloudWatch alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/configure-cloudwatch.html)\.
