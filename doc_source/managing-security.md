# Security best practices for Amazon Cognito user pools<a name="managing-security"></a>

You can add multi\-factor authentication \(MFA\) to a user pool to protect the identity of your users\. MFA adds a second authentication method that doesn't rely solely on user name and password\. You can choose to use SMS text messages, or time\-based one\-time \(TOTP\) passwords as second factors in signing in your users\. You can also use adaptive authentication with its risk\-based model to predict when you might need another authentication factor\. It's part of the user pool advanced security features, which also include protections against compromised credentials\.
