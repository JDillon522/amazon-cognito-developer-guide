# Adding groups to a user pool<a name="cognito-user-pools-user-groups"></a>

Support for groups in Amazon Cognito user pools enables you to create and manage groups, add users to groups, and remove users from groups\. Use groups to create collections of users to manage their permissions or to represent different types of users\. You can assign an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) role to a group to define the permissions for members of a group\.

You can use groups to create a collection of users in a user pool, which is often done to set the permissions for those users\. For example, you can create separate groups for users who are readers, contributors, and editors of your website and app\. Using the IAM role associated with a group, you can also set different permissions for those different groups so that only contributors can put content into Amazon S3 and only editors can publish content through an API in Amazon API Gateway\.

You can create and manage groups in a user pool from the AWS Management Console, the APIs, and the CLI\. As a developer \(using AWS credentials\), you can create, read, update, delete, and list the groups for a user pool\. You can also add users and remove users from groups\.

There is no additional cost for using groups within a user pool\. See [Amazon Cognito Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/pricing/) for more information\.

You can see this feature used in the [SpaceFinder](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-serverless-auth-reference-app) reference app\.

## Assigning IAM roles to groups<a name="assigning-iam-roles-to-groups"></a>

You can use groups to control permissions to your resources using an IAM role\. IAM roles include trust policies and permission policies\. The role [trust](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/role-trust-and-permissions.html) policy specifies who can use the role\. The [permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/iam-roles.html#access-policies) policies specify the actions and resources that your group members can access\. When you create an IAM role, set up the role trust policy to allow your group's users to assume the role\. In the role permissions policies, specify the permissions that you want your group to have\.

When you create a group in Amazon Cognito, you specify an IAM role by providing the roleâ€™s [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-arns)\. When group members sign in using Amazon Cognito, they can receive temporary credentials from the identity pools\. Their permissions are determined by the associated IAM role\.

Individual users can be in multiple groups\. As a developer, you have the following options for automatically choosing the IAM role when a user is in multiple groups:
+ You can assign precedence values to each group\. The group with the better \(lower\) precedence will be chosen and its associated IAM role will be applied\. 
+ Your app can also choose from among the available roles when requesting AWS credentials for a user through an identity pool, by specifying a role ARN in the [GetCredentialsForIdentity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognitoidentity/latest/APIReference/API_GetCredentialsForIdentity.html) `CustomRoleARN` parameter\. The specified IAM role must match a role that is available to the user\.

## Assigning precedence values to groups<a name="assigning-precedence-values-to-groups"></a>

A user can belong to more than one group\. In the user's ID token, the `cognito:groups` claim contains the list of all the groups a user belongs to\. The `cognito:roles` claim contains the list of roles corresponding to the groups\.

Because a user can belong to more than one group, each group can be assigned a precedence\. This is a non\-negative number that specifies the precedence of this group relative to the other groups that a user belongs to in the user pool\. Zero is the top precedence value\. Groups with lower precedence values take precedence over groups with higher or null precedence values\. If a user belongs to two or more groups, the group with the lowest precedence value will have its IAM role applied to the `cognito:preferred_role` claim in the user's ID token\.

Two groups can have the same precedence value\. If this happens, neither group takes precedence over the other\. If two groups with the same precedence value have the same role ARN, that role is used in the `cognito:preferred_role` claim in ID tokens for users in each group\. If the two groups have different role ARNs, the `cognito:preferred_role` claim is not set in users' ID tokens\.

## Using groups to control permission with Amazon API Gateway<a name="using-groups-to-control-permission-with-amazon-api-gateway"></a>

You can use groups in a user pool to control permission with Amazon API Gateway\. The groups that a user is a member of are included in both the ID token and access token from a user pool in the `cognito:groups` claim\. You can submit ID or access tokens with requests to Amazon API Gateway and use an Amazon Cognito user pool authorizer for a REST API\. For more information, see [Control access to a REST API using Amazon Cognito user pools as authorizer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-integrate-with-cognito.html) in the [API Gateway Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/)\.

You can also authorize access to an Amazon API Gateway HTTP API with a custom JWT authorizer\. For more information, see [Controlling access to HTTP APIs with JWT authorizers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-jwt-authorizer.html) in the [API Gateway Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/)\.

## Limitations on groups<a name="user-pool-user-groups-limitations"></a>

User groups are subject to the following limitations:
+ The number of groups you can create is limited by the [Amazon Cognito service limits](limits.md)\.
+ Groups cannot be nested\.
+ You cannot search for users in a group\.
+ You cannot search for groups by name, but you can list groups\.
+ Only groups with no members can be deleted\.

## Creating a new group in the AWS Management Console<a name="creating-a-new-group-using-the-console"></a>

Use the following procedure to create a new group\.

------
#### [ Original console ]

The **Groups** tab in the **Users and groups** tab has a **Create group** button\.

![\[Create a new group in the Groups tab in the Users and groups tab.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/)![\[Create a new group in the Groups tab in the Users and groups tab.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/)![\[Create a new group in the Groups tab in the Users and groups tab.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/)

When you choose **Create group**, a **Create group** form appears\. You'll enter your group's information into this form\. Only the **Name** field is required\. If you are integrating a user pool with an identity pool, the **IAM role** setting determines which role is assigned in the user's ID token if the identity pool is configured to choose the role from the token\. If you don't have roles already defined, choose **Create new role**\. If you have more than one group, and your users can be assigned to more than one group, you can set a **Precedence** value for each group\. The precedence value can be any non\-negative integer\. Zero is the top precedence value\.

![\[Create group form in the Users and groups tab.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/)![\[Create group form in the Users and groups tab.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/)![\[Create group form in the Users and groups tab.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/)

------
#### [ New console ]

**To create a new group**

1. Go to the [Amazon Cognito console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/home)\. If prompted, enter your AWS credentials\.

1. Choose **User Pools**\.

1. Choose an existing user pool from the list\.

1. Choose the **Groups** tab, and then choose **Create a group**\.

1. On the **Create a group** page, in **Group name**, enter a friendly name for your new group\.

1. You can optionally provide additional information about this group using any of the following fields:
   + **Description** \- Enter details about what this new group will be used for\.
   + **Precedence** \- Amazon Cognito evaluates and applies all group permissions for a given user based on which groups that they belong to has a lower precedence value\. The group with the lower precedence will be chosen and its associated IAM role will be applied\. For more information, see [Assigning precedence values to groups](#assigning-precedence-values-to-groups)\.
   + **IAM role** \- You can assign an IAM role to your group when you need to control permissions to your resources\. If you are integrating a user pool with an identity pool, the **IAM role** setting determines which role is assigned in the user's ID token if the identity pool is configured to choose the role from the token\. For more information, see [Assigning IAM roles to groups](#assigning-iam-roles-to-groups)\.
   + **Add users to this group** \- Add existing users as members of this group after it is created\.

1. Choose **Create** to confirm\.
