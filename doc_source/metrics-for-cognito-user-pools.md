# Metrics for Amazon Cognito user pools<a name="metrics-for-cognito-user-pools"></a>

The following table lists the metrics available for Amazon Cognito user pools\.

**Note**  
Metrics that haven't had any new data points in the past two weeks don't appear in the console\. They also don't appear when you enter their metric name or dimension names in the search box in the **All metrics** tab in the console\. In addition, they are not returned in the results of a list\-metrics command\. The best way to retrieve these metrics is with the `get-metric-data` or `get-metric-statistics` commands in the AWS CLI\.


| Metric | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| SignUpSuccesses |  Provides the total number of successful user registration requests made to the Amazon Cognito user pool\. A successful user registration request produces a value of 1, whereas an unsuccessful request produces a value of 0\. A throttled request is also considered as an unsuccessful request, and hence a throttled request will also produce a count of 0\. To find the percentage of successful user registration requests, use the `Average` statistic on this metric\. To count the total number of user registration requests, use the `Sample Count` statistic on this metric\. To count the total number of successful user registration requests, use the `Sum` statistic on this metric\. To count the total number of failed user registration requests, use the CloudWatch `Math` expression and subtract the `Sum` statistic from the `Sample Count` statistic\. This metric is published for each user pool for each user pool client\. In case when the user registration is performed by an admin, the metric is published with the user pool client as `Admin`\. Note that this metric is not emitted for [User import](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-using-import-tool.html) and [User migration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-import-using-lambda.html) cases\. Metric dimension: `UserPool`, `UserPoolClient` Units: Count  | 
| SignUpThrottles |  Provides the total number of throttled user registration requests made to the Amazon Cognito user pool\. A count of 1 is published whenever a user registration request is throttled\.  To count the total number of throttled user registration requests, use the `Sum` statistic for this metric\. This metric is published for each user pool for each client\. In case when the request that was throttled was made by an administrator, the metric is published with user pool client as `Admin`\. Metric dimension: `UserPool`, `UserPoolClient` Units: Count  | 
| SignInSuccesses |  Provides the total number of successful user authentication requests made to the Amazon Cognito user pool\. A user authentication is considered successful when authentication token is issued to the user\. A successful authentication produces a value of 1, whereas an unsuccessful request produces a value of 0\. A throttled request is also considered as an unsuccessful request, and hence a throttled request will also produce a count of 0\.  To find the percentage of successful user authentication requests, use the `Average` statistic on this metric\. To count the total number of user authentication requests, use the `Sample Count` statistic on this metric\. To count the total number of successful user authentication requests, use the `Sum` statistic on this metric\. To count the total number of failed user authentication requests, use the CloudWatch `Math` expression and subtract the `Sum` statistic from the `Sample Count` statistic\. This metric is published for each user pool for each client\. In case an invalid user pool client is provided with a request, the corresponding user pool client value in the metric contains a fixed value `Invalid` instead of the actual invalid value sent in the request\. Note that requests to refresh the Amazon Cognito token is not included in this metric\. There is a separate metric for providing `Refresh` token statistics\. Metric dimension: `UserPool`, `UserPoolClient` Units: Count  | 
| SignInThrottles |  Provides the total number of throttled user authentication requests made to the Amazon Cognito user pool\. A count of 1 is published whenever an authentication request is throttled\. To count the total number of throttled user authentication requests, use the `Sum` statistic for this metric\. This metric is published for each user pool for each client\. In case an invalid user pool client is provided with a request, the corresponding user pool client value in the metric contains a fixed value `Invalid` instead of the actual invalid value sent in the request\. Requests to refresh Amazon Cognito token is not included in this metric\. There is a separate metric for providing `Refresh` token statistics\. Metric dimension: `UserPool`, `UserPoolClient` Units: Count  | 
| TokenRefreshSuccesses |  Provides the total number of successful requests to refresh an Amazon Cognito token that were made to the Amazon Cognito user pool\. A successful refresh Amazon Cognito token request produces a value of 1, whereas an unsuccessful request produces a value of 0\. A throttled request is also considered as an unsuccessful request, and hence a throttled request will also produce a count of 0\.  To find the percentage of successful requests to refresh an Amazon Cognito token, use the `Average` statistic on this metric\. To count the total number of requests to refresh an Amazon Cognito token, use the `Sample Count` statistic on this metric\. To count the total number of successful requests to refresh an Amazon Cognito token, use the `Sum` statistic on this metric\. To count the total number of failed requests to refresh an Amazon Cognito token, use the CloudWatch `Math` expression and subtract the `Sum` statistic from the `Sample Count` statistic\. This metric is published per each user pool client\. If an invalid user pool client is in a request, the user pool client value contains a fixed value of `Invalid`\. Metric dimension: `UserPool`, `UserPoolClient` Units: Count  | 
| TokenRefreshThrottles |  Provides the total number of throttled requests to refresh an Amazon Cognito token that were made to the Amazon Cognito user pool\. A count of 1 is published whenever a refresh Amazon Cognito token request is throttled\. To count the total number of throttled requests to refresh an Amazon Cognito token, use the `Sum` statistic for this metric\. This metric is published for each user pool for each client\. In case an invalid user pool client is provided with a request, corresponding user pool client value in the metric contains a fixed value `Invalid` instead of the actual invalid value sent in the request\. Metric dimension: `UserPool`, `UserPoolClient` Units: Count  | 
| FederationSuccesses |  Provides the total number of successful identity federation requests to the Amazon Cognito user pool\. A successful identity federation request produces a value of 1, whereas an unsuccessful request produces a value of 0\. A throttled request is also considered as an unsuccessful request, and hence a throttled request will also produce a count of 0\.  To find the percentage of successful identity federation requests, use the `Average` statistic on this metric\. To count the total number of identity federation requests, use the `Sample Count` statistic on this metric\. To count the total number of successful identity federation requests, use the `Sum` statistic on this metric\. To count the total number of failed identity federation requests, use the CloudWatch `Math` expression and subtract the `Sum` statistic from the `Sample Count` statistic\. Metric dimension: `UserPool`, `UserPoolClient`, `IdentityProvider` Units: Count  | 
| FederationThrottles |  Provides the total number of throttled identity federation requests to the Amazon Cognito user pool\. A count of 1 is published whenever an identity federation request is throttled\. To count the total number of throttled identity federation requests, use the `Sum` statistic for this metric\. Metric dimension: `UserPool`, `UserPoolClient`, `IdentityProvider` Units: Count  | 
| CallCount |  Provides the total number of calls customers made related to a category\. This metric includes all the calls, such as throttled calls, failed calls, and successful calls\. This metric is available in the **Usage** `nameSpace`\. The category quota is enforced for each AWS account across all user pools in an account and Region\.  You can count the total number of calls in a category using the `Sum` statistic for this metric\. Metric dimension: Service, Type, Resource, Class Units: Count  | 
| ThrottleCount |  Provides the total number of throttled calls related to a category\.  This metric is available in the **Usage** `nameSpace`\. This metric is published at the account level\. You can count the total number of calls in a category, using the `Sum` statistic for this metric\. Metric dimension: Service, Type, Resource, Class Units: Count  |
