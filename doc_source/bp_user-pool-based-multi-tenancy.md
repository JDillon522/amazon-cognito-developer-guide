# User pool\-based multi\-tenancy<a name="bp_user-pool-based-multi-tenancy"></a>

With this design, you can create a user pool for each tenant in your application\. This approach provides maximum isolation for each tenant and allows you to implement different configurations for each tenant\. Tenant isolation by user pool allows you flexibility in user\-to\-tenant mapping\. It also allows multiple profiles for the same user\. However, each user has to sign up individually for each tenant they have access to\. Using this approach allows you to set up hosted UI for each tenant independently and redirect users to their tenant\-specific instance of your application\. This approach also allows easier integration with backend services like API Gateway\. We recommend this approach in the following scenarios\. 
+ Your application has different configurations for each tenant\. For example, data residency requirements, password policy, and MFA configurations can be different for each tenant\. 
+ Your application has complex user\-to\-tenant role mapping\. For example, a single user could be a “Student” in tenant A and the same user could also be a “Teacher” in tenant B\. 
+ Your application uses the default Amazon Cognito hosted UI as the primary authentication method for native users\. \(Native users are those that have been created in the user pool with user name and password\)\. 
+ Your application has a silo multi\-tenant application where each tenant gets a full instance of your application infrastructure for their usage\. 

 **Effort level** 

The development and operation effort to use this approach is high\. You need to build tenant onboarding and administration components into your application that uses Amazon Cognito API operations and automation tools\. These components are necessary to create the required resources for each tenant\. You also need to implement a tenant\-matching user interface\. In addition, you must add logic to your application that allows users to sign up and sign in to their corresponding tenant’s user pool\.
