# Using the Amazon Cognito console<a name="cognito-console"></a>

 You can use the [Amazon Cognito console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/home) to create and manage user pools and identity pools\.

This guide provides step\-by\-step walkthroughs for common Amazon Cognito user pool tasks in both the original Amazon Cognito console \(referred to as the *original console*\), and the November 2021 console update \(the *new console*\)\. The new console update revises workflows for most actions in the Amazon Cognito user pools console\. It does not change the Amazon Cognito API that underpins AWS SDKs and the AWS Command Line Interface\.

**New console experience highlights**
+ Logical grouping of features
+ A user pool creation wizard
+ Informative instructions that emphasize the user experience in your app
+ Dynamic assistance with user pool configuration
  + Pop\-out help text
  + Filtered views
  + App category settings and suggested presets
  + Warnings about irreversible configuration choices
+ Updated information on resource limits and the limitations of user pool configuration

To get started with the new Amazon Cognito user pools console, select the link in the invitation banner displayed in your console\. You can revert to the original console after previewing the new console experience\.
